# Global Wetland Water Level Database (GWWLD)

Author: Etienne Fluet-Chouinard 

We initiate an effort to compile all available data on water level in VIEs, and solicit data contributions from across the world. The Global Wetland Water Level DataBase (GWWLD) aims to contain daily and sub-daily water level times at point locations of any land surface type, coastal or inland, experiencing water level fluctuations within 1.0 meter below the soil surface of above it. Measurements collected can originate from continuous logging with a piezometer or pressure transducer, intermittent observations from a staff/ruler gauge or other emerging technologies including photography and STIC sensors. Raw measures of water table elevation relative to a vertical datum is processed into a metric of water table position (WTP) relative to the soil surface for easy use in remote sensing, modeling and geostatistical analyses.
